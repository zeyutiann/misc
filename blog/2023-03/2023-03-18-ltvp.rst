Things I can improve on on this research
========================================
* symptoms:
    My gathering of info is extremely inefficient, i seem to ask the right questions, but I was not finding the correct resources.

* diagnosis:
    * My inner thoughts are not always logical, it's sentimental...
    * it also seems that I have issue comprehending some wordings, I tend to misread and stuck at some obvious mistakes.

    * There are tons of information online, i search here a little bit, search there a little bit, but i wasn't able to get a good overview of the topic until I am searching for it for a few hours.
    * the actual topics I'm interested:
        * there are different LTVP, what are their difference:
        * what is the difference between DP vs LTVP
        * does parents need to reside in SG to apply for LTVP?

            I thought yes, and I was stuck at this for very long.

            I thought they need a short term visa to come to SG, and when IPA, they need to be here to collect them.
            *meaning, i thought they don't have to be here right now when you apply for it, but you can apply first, and slowly make their way there...*

            but it's a No: If you apply for LTVP, he/she needs to travel to SG within 3 months, which needs some planning

            I tend to search for chinese resources, these chinese resources doesn't seem to answer for my questions, which is odd (i does suggest that, i might have been looking at the wrong directions!)

            then I was worried about dates they need to confirm,

        * what are the steps
        * what are the info/documents required for each steps

    * I searched all these things, but i kept jumping around and I forgot about important notes, as I don't really keep track of them...


* improvements:

    write down existing knowledge -> some of them maybe wrong, and I won't tell what's wrong until i can conceptualise it into a sentence.

    write down questions

    write summary on researches and links

    talk to someone, or ask someone who knows...
