Headsail maneuver
##################


Headsail Trimming
==================
* Close Haul: Sails in tight
* Close Reach: 1-2 feet outside lifelines
* Beam Reach: 3-4 feet outside lifelines
* Broad Reach & Run: Sail comes off furler at 90% Angle
* Use Telltales to fine tune sail:
    * Bottom 2 rows of telltales are the most important, they should flow back really nicely.
    * Top telltales can be laughing about 50% of the time
    * Jib car on the track, move forward a little bit
