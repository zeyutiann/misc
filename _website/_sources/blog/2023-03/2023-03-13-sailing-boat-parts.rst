Sailboat Parts
###############

Type of Rigging:
=================

There are two types of rigging: running and standing rigging. The difference between the two is very simple.

* The running rigging is the rigging on a sailboat that's used to operate the sails. For example, the halyard, which is used to lower and heave the mainsail.
* The standing rigging is the rigging that is used to support the mast and sail plan.

Component of Mast
=================
* Main Halyard - The main halyard is attached to the head of the sail and is used to pull the sail up the mast.
    .. note::
        Never letgo of topping lift

* Topping Lift - The topping lift holds the back of the boom up, It supports the boom whenever you take down the mainsail.
* Bolt Rope - The bolt rope provides strength to the luff of the sail and is used also to slide into the track if there is one. On a head sail the bolt rope provides strength to the luff of the sail when “hanks” are used.
* Primary Reefing Point/Secondary Reefing Point - The reefing points are points where the sail can be pulled down in order to reef the sail if a roller furling system is not used.
* Primary Reefing Line/Secondary Reefing Line
* Boom Vang - The boom vang holds the boom down when beating to wind.

    .. note::
        On down wind legs, the boom vang can be loosened to provide more shape to the sail.

* Mainsheet - The line, or sheet, that is used to set the angle of the mainsail. The mainsheet is attached to the Mainsheet traveler
* Outhaul - The outhaul line is attached to the clew to pull the sail out along the boom, controls the foot tension.
* Cunningham (downhaul) - pulls the sail down tight and is also used  when reefing
* Gooseneck - The gooseneck is a swivel connection from the boom to the mast.
